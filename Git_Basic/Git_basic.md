**What is Git and GitHub?**

GIT stands for Global Information Tracker. GIT is basically version control system. For example if I create any file and then I changed or overwrite anything then the 1 st file will be my version one and then new will be version 2. This is done by GIT

There are two types of version control system. DVCS and CVCS these are two types. DVCS is distributed version control system and CVCS is centralised version control system. Example of CVCS is SVN and DVCS is GIT. 

You store your stuff in Repository. You can store any file. Repository is folder. Every repository of GIT is version controled. 

**If Repo is situated in your Computer then it is Local Repository**.

**If Repo is situated on different server  then it is Remote Repository.**

There are three stages is VCS.

1. FileSystem

2. Staging

3. VCS
